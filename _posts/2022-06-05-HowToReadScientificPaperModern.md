# The scientific paper on the pedestal
The scientific paper - the pinacle of knowledge sharing where bright minds and the professor you only saw from distance share there latest finding and insight in a rigorous, scientific, truth seeking method; - Or so I thought, as a kid, undergrad and then an master student. These tomes was the real deal; state-of-the-art and not the undergrad course books that _teached_ you knowledge in a friendly manner, assumed to be used in tandem with an teacher; those were pure knowledge put out there; reading it wasn't supposed to be easy and you just gotta learn the nomenclature, and extracting the knowledge from it was your job.

Scientists and Scientific litterature are put on a very high pedestal. From young age we are told that this is the community you should aspire for if you're seeking knowledge. The first time you _have_ to read a scientific paper, be it a part of undergrad course or a master thesis, you're often hit with a brickwall of information; more so if you're not native English speaker. Naturally the first course of action is question oneselfs prior knowledge and intellect, _suspecting fault in the material you're reading is a thought that comes after the last thought you have_.

Before reading scientific papers became a hobby and then part of my job.

However most guides written _assumes that you're a PhD or a researcher in training_ and often not a hobby/layman person. So I'll focus on this bit too

## The layman (pre-researcher)
* TODO: Check my old notes, on Notion?
* Understand that the paper omit a lot of detail, often even in a conflicting way to the _idealized view of the scientific process as that of honest knowledge seeking_. This is something (I presume) PhDs will learn along their journey fairly quickly, having to go through the cryptic "be honest - submit -> get rejection -> omit unfavourable details from _same_ work -> accept" review process. In essence it's not so different from a resume. It's highly likely that what's written there is not a lie, but you can't take it on the face value.


## The modern tooling

* Reading groups. Generally, when you discuss a paper from a 3rd source in a reading group, there will be the optimist ("The result is very compelling!") and the pessimist ("The figure 3 makes my eyebrows twitch") and almost never someone in the middle. People either like an idea someone else did that match their interest/world view or hate it because they did it before them or in a way that doesn't conform to their view of the matter. Find a healthy balance of both in your group.
