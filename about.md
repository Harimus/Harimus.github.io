## About me:
Hello! My name is Dan, a Robotics Software Engineer turned Robotics Learning researcher. I'm from Stockholm Sweden but currently live in Tokyo, Japan. 

The title of the site is inspired by [LessWrong](lesswrong.com). I have a lot of incomplete thoughts, majority of them I just forget or archive with a footnote. Some of them budge me more than twice and I write it down in my second-brain. Very select few of those, I get the urge to formulate it with consistency to form an opinion/argument, and few of those *might* be valuable (to me) to share. But an idea/thought are not complete without proper criticism, and while it's a rather uncomfortable experience, the idea and the process of generating the idea grow a lot from it. Noticing that I'm wrong today is the first step to be less wrong tomorrow, and I can't really achieve that if I don't get feedback about my incomplete ideas!

I intend to use my GithubPage in two ways:
* Ponder on some ideas & hypotheses I've had that I'm not sure are correct. Sharing the idea is about getting feedback on it to refine my [mental model](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)
* Share some projects I've done in my work & spare-time that I think could be worth sharing to some people. Probably software stuff in robotics, or hobbies
