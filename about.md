## About me:
Hello! My name is Dan Ogawa Lillrank, a humble Robotics Software Engineer turned Robotics Learning researcher. I'm from Stockholm Sweden but currently live in Tokyo, Japan.

I intend to use my GithubPage in two ways:
* Ponder on some ideas & hypothesis I've had that I'm not sure is correct. Sharing the idea is about getting feedback on it to refine my [mental model](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)
* Share some projects I've done in my work & sparetime that I think could be worth sharing to some people
