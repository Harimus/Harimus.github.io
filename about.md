## About me:
Hello! My name is Dan Ogawa Lillrank, a Robotics Software Engineer turned Robotics Learning researcher. I'm from Stockholm Sweden but currently live in Tokyo, Japan. 

The title of the blog comes from the idea that I'd like to constantly be pointed out my wrongs; it's a rather uncomfortable experience but I think I grow a lot from it. Noticing that I'm wrong today is the first step to be less wrong tomorrow, and I can't really achieve that if I don't get feedback about my incomplete ideas!

I intend to use my GithubPage in two ways:
* Ponder on some ideas & hypotheses I've had that I'm not sure are correct. Sharing the idea is about getting feedback on it to refine my [mental model](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)
* Share some projects I've done in my work & sparetime that I think could be worth sharing to some people
